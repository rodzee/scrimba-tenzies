# Tenzies App Project - Second Scrimba Course

## First Challenge

1. Start a brand new React app!
2. Create a separate App component
3. Import and render the App component here
4. In the App component, render a <main> element
5. Style everything to look like the slide

> Result to complete on my own `Success 👍`

## Second Challenge

1. Create a Die component that takes a `value` prop

2. Render 10 instances of the Die component (manually)

3. Provide a number between 1-6 for the value on each for now

4. Style the <main> and <Die> components to look like they do in the slide

**_Hint 1:_** _Create a container to hold the 10 instances of the Die component,
and use CSS Grid to lay them out evenly in 2 rows of 5 columns_

**_Hint 2:_** _Use flexbox on main to center the dice container
in the center of the page_

> Result to complete on my own `Success 🥳`

## Third Challenge

1. Write a function (allNewDice) that returns an array of 10 random
   numbers between 1-6 inclusive.

2. Log the array of numbers to the console for now

> Result to complete on my own `Success!!!`

## Forth Challenge

1. Create state to hold our array of numbers. (Initialize the state by calling
   our `allNewDice` function so it loads all new dice as soon as the app loads)

2. Map over the state numbers array to generate our array of Die elements and
   render those in place of our manually-written 10 Die elements.

> Result to complete on my own `Success 🎉🎉🎉`

## Fifth Challenge

1. Create a `Roll Dice` button that will re-roll all 10 dice

2. Clicking the button should generate a new array of numbers
   and set the `dice` state to that new array (thus re-rendering
   the array to the page)

> Result to complete on my own `Success, Let's Go!`
